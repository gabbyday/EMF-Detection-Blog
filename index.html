                                        <p>Hello, my name is Gabby and I am a current senior at Washington University in St. Louis.
                                        I am pursuing two bachelor's degrees in electrical engineering and computer engineering.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Like most students, I have been noticing a trend in an increased use of electronic devices in our everyday lives.
                                        Little changes like using an iPad for note-taking instead of the classic notebook or opting for an electric toothbrush over the manual kind.
                                        It got me wondering, what's the potential impact of increased artificial EMF exposure on our health?
                                        </p>
                                        <p>If you're like me and curious to find out, I will be uncovering some of these mysteries surrounding EMF radiation to get a better understanding of what these invisible waves are capable of.
                                        I will be running an EMF assessment on the presence associated with common electrical devices from the perspective of a student. Some of the results may surprise you!
                                        </p>
                                    </div>

                                <h4>What is EMF Radiation?</h4>
                                <p>Anything that has electrical charges produces electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation.
                                EMFs are a natural phenomenon that have existed long before humans.
                                However, with the rise in electronic device usage, humans are now more exposed to varying degrees of EMF radiation [1].
                                </p>
                                <p>We have established that EMFs are electromagnetic fields.
                                Now what exactly does that mean?
                                Electromagnetic fields are formed from the propogation of orthogonal electric and magnetic fields.
                                Think of them like the ripples that spread when you drop a pebble into water. 
                                These invisible waves carry energy and information through the air, allowing our devices to communicate wirelessly.
                                </p>
                                <div class="image">

                                </div>
                                <p>Different metrics are used to measure both. Let's assess the two [1]:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Electric Fields:</strong>
                                        <ul class="sub-list">
                                            <li>Created by differences in voltage</li>
                                            <li>The higher the voltage, the stronger the electric field</li>
                                            <li>Units of volts per meter [V/m]</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Magnetic Fields:</strong>
                                        <ul class="sub-list">
                                            <li>Created when electric current flows</li>
                                            <li>The higher the current, the stronger the magnetic field</li>
                                            <li>Units of micro teslas [uT]</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>It is important to note that there are other metrics used to measure EMF radiation levels such as [ADD]. 
                                Due to the nature of my measurement device, I will be focusing on just the electric and magnetic field strengths.
                                </p>
                                <p>Is all EMF radiation bad? When people think of radiation, it is easy to think only of the nuclear waste kind.
                                In fact, there is a whole spectrum of EMF radiation to consider. Even humans emit EMF radiation!
                                There are two types of EMF radiation that we can classify [2]:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Non-Ionizing:</strong> Low to mid-level frequency radiation which is generally perceived as harmless to humans.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Ionizing:</strong> High-level frequency radiation that may cause cellular and DNA damage.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/emf/index.cfm</p>
                                <p>Commonly used devices operate at different ionizing levels.
                                    Most devices that humans are exposed to daily emit non-ionizing radiation.
                                </p>  
                            </div>

                                <p>Quite scary isn't it? Before we jump to any conclusions, let's dig a little deeper into the matter.
                                We can start by assessing how we may be exposed to EMF radiation on a daily basis.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                            <div id="item-2">
                                <h4>How are Students Exposed?</h4>
                                <p>In the digital age, us students find ourselves surrounded by electronic devices such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, and more.
                                While these devices have revolutionized the way we learn and collaborate, they have also brought forth a concerning issue regarding EMF radiation exposure.
                                I will be going through a day in my life as a student to assess the presence of EMF radiation in everyday activities.
                                </p>
                                <p>For the EMF radiation tests, I will be measuring the fields from the same distance and the same device mode as I would normally do when using the device.
                                The EMF measurement device I will be using is manufactured by the company NOPWOK and was bought online for around $25.
                                This reader is capable of measuring both the electric field strength in V/m and the magnetic field in strength uT.
                                It is important to note that this device was relatively cheap compared to other EMF readers. 
                                It is a non-directional meter, meaning that it does not consider EMF field direction during measurements [https://www.radiationhealthrisks.com/best-emf-rf-meters-and-detectors/].
                                This may lead to a trade-off in accuracy for the readings when compared to more expensive models.

                            <p>From the measurements, there are several interesting things to take note of.
                            The device with the largest electric field strength was a bluetooth earbud with a value of 104 V/m. 
                            This is alarming to hear, especially given that the device is essential pressed into your head upon usage.
                            Also up there were kitchen appliances, a fridge, an electric kettle and a microwave, with values 82 V/m, 49 V/m, and 42 V/m respectively.
                            Because these devices are such kitchen staples, it is easy to brush past the EMF fields they may be generating.
                            The device with the largest magnetic field strength was an electric toothbrush at 19.59 uT. 
                            As with the bluetooth earbuds, it is startling to note the proximity to a vital organ relying on electrical signals to function, the brain.
                            The kitchen appliances mentioned above also had higher magnetic field strength values.

                                <h5>How do EMFs Influence the Human Body?</h5>
                                <p>Both electric and magnetic fields are capable of inducing voltages and currents in the human body.
                                The human body relies on electric charges to function through biochemical reactions.    
                                For example, our brain activity, digestive behavior, and heartbeat are all electrically active.
                                The strength of the induced current and voltage depends on the intensity of the EMF radiation exposure.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>Now the question is, are they dangerous enough to create adverse effects on the body? 
                                Heating is the main biological effect of EMF fields.
                                To date, scientists and regulatory agencies agree that low-frequency EMFs pose little danger to human health.
                                The human body is extremely sophisticated and has mechanisms within to adjust to the various influences of our environment.
                                With that being said, it is admitted that more research is needed especially for long-term exposure.
                                Stress on our biological system for a prolonged period of time may contribute to a health risk [1].
                                Just think about how close your phone is to your body at all points of the day!

                                <p>As you can probably notice, there are a ton of inconsistencies regarding EMF effects on the human body.
                                Several of such claims were analyzed in a systematic review.
                                Many of them were found to have issues with the way experiments were conducted. 
                                It was concluded that there were likely no concerning physical effects on the body. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6805477/].

                                <p>While there is still so much unknown regarding EMF radiation, it is still better to play it safe than sorry when talking about exposure.
                                Here are some simple ways in which you can control your intake of EMF radiation:
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Move farther away from a device.</strong></li>
                                    <p>EMF radiation has an inverse square relationship with distance. 
                                    Exposure rapidly decreases as distance from the source increases.
