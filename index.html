                                        <p>Hello, my name is Gabby, and I am a current senior at Washington University in St. Louis. 
                                        I am pursuing two bachelor's degrees in electrical engineering and computer engineering.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Like most students, I have noticed a trend in the increased use of electronic devices in our everyday lives. 
                                        I have made small changes like using an iPad for notetaking instead of the classic notebook or opting for an electric toothbrush over the manual kind. 
                                        It got me wondering, what's the potential impact of increased artificial EMF exposure on our health?
                                        </p>
                                        <p>If you're like me and curious to find out, I will be uncovering some of these mysteries surrounding EMF radiation. 
                                        I hope to get a better understanding of what these invisible waves are capable of. 
                                        I will be running an EMF presence assessment on common electrical devices from the perspective of a student.
                                        Some of the results may surprise you!

                                <h4>What is EMF Radiation?</h4>
                                <p>Anything that has electrical charges produces electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation. 
                                EMFs are a natural phenomenon that have existed long before humans. 
                                Think about lightning, the North Pole, and even galaxies. 
                                These are all sources of natural EMF radiation. 
                                However, with the rise in electronic device usage, humans are now more exposed to an increased degree of artificial EMF radiation from things like phones, laptops, and tablets [1].
                                </p>
                                <p>We have established that EMFs are electromagnetic fields. 
                                Now what exactly does that mean? 
                                Electromagnetic fields are formed from the propagation of orthogonal electric and magnetic fields as detailed below in Figure 1. 
                                Think of them like the ripples that spread when you drop a pebble into water. 
                                These waves can carry energy and information through the air, allowing our devices to communicate wirelessly.
                                </p>
                                <div class="image">

                                <p class="figure-label"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Propagating electric and magnetic wave [2]</p>
                                <p>Different metrics are used to measure both. Let's assess the two [1]:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Electric Field Strength (E-Field):</strong>
                                        <ul class="sub-list">
                                            <li>Created by differences in voltage</li>
                                            <li>The higher the voltage, the stronger the electric field</li>
                                            <li>Units of volts per meter [V/m]</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Magnetic Flux Density (B-Field):</strong>
                                        <ul class="sub-list">
                                            <li>Created when electric current flows</li>
                                            <li>The higher the current, the stronger the magnetic field</li>
                                            <li>Units of micro teslas [uT]</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>It is important to note that there are other metrics used to measure EMF radiation levels such as power density [W/m^2] and magnetic field strength [A/m] [3]. 
                                Due to the nature of my measurement device, I will be focusing on just the electric field strength and magnetic flux density. 
                                Together, these two metrics provide the necessary information required for a holistic assessment of EMF radiation.
                                </p> 
                            </div>

                                <h5>Is all EMF Radiation Bad?</h5>
                                <p>When people think of radiation, it is easy to think only of the nuclear waste kind. 
                                In fact, there is a whole spectrum of EMF radiation to consider further explained in Figure 2 below. 
                                Even humans emit EMF radiation! There are two types of EMF radiation that we can classify [4]:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Non-Ionizing:</strong> Low to mid-level frequency radiation which is generally perceived as harmless to humans.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Ionizing:</strong> High-level frequency radiation that may cause cellular and DNA damage.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <div class="image">
                                    <img class="emf-chart" src="EMF Spectrum.jpg" alt="EMF Radiation Chart">
                                </div>
                                <p class="figure-label"><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Devices on the electromagnetic spectrum [4]</p>
                                <p>Commonly used devices operate at different ionizing levels. 
                                Most devices that humans are exposed to daily emit non-ionizing radiation. 
                                Unlike ionizing radiation, non-ionizing radiation does not have sufficient energy required to remove electrons from atoms and molecules. 
                                Instead, the main effect non-ionizing radiation has on substances is heat [5]. 
                                This is the primary purpose of your microwave!
                                </p>
                                <p>Another metric that is an important factor to consider is operating frequency. 
                                Most power lines operate at 60Hz [6]. 
                                While it is sufficient for devices such as alarm clocks to operate, it is not a high enough frequency to support efficient data transmission for devices such as cell phones. 
                                For example, the Wi-Fi router that is currently in my apartment operates at a much higher frequency of 2.4 GHz. 
                                To better understand how information is encoded in frequency, think of two friends sending Morse code signals across a river. 
                                Each flash sent contains a small packet of information. 
                                Say one person can flash 50 words per minute while the other can flash 60 words per minute. 
                                The second person can send more information in a shorter period, which is equivalent to saying that they operate at a higher frequency. 
                                It is important to consider frequency when evaluating EMFs because alternating how a signal switches from high to low creates a polarity change with an EMF wave. 
                                The faster the switching, or the higher the frequency, the more waves are generated [6].

                                <p>Quite scary isn't it? The internet is buzzing with a growing concern regarding EMF radiation. 
                                Before we jump to any conclusions, let's dig a little deeper into the matter. 
                                We can start by assessing how we may be exposed to EMF radiation on a daily basis.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                            <div id="item-4">
                                <h4>How are Students Exposed?</h4>
                                <p>In the digital age, we students find ourselves surrounded by electronic devices such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, and more. 
                                While these devices have revolutionized how we learn and collaborate, they have also brought forth a concerning issue regarding EMF radiation exposure. 
                                I will be going through a day in my life as a student to assess the presence of EMF radiation in everyday activities.
                                </p>
                                <p>For the EMF radiation tests, I will be measuring the fields from the same distance and the same device mode as I would normally do when using the device. 
                                The EMF measurement device in Figure 4 I will be using is manufactured by the company NOPWOK and was bought online for around $25 [10]. 
                                This reader is capable of measuring both the electric field strength in V/m and the magnetic flux density in uT. 
                                This device was cheaper compared to other EMF readers available on the market. 
                                It is a non-directional meter, meaning that it does not consider EMF field direction during measurements [11]. 
                                This may lead to a trade-off in accuracy for the readings when compared to more expensive models. 
                                Despite this, it is still a great option for students and those looking to run experiments in a casual setting. 
                                I have confidence that the measurements from the device can yield meaningful results.

                                From the moment I wake up to the time I go to bed, I find myself consistently plugged into all things electronic. 
                                To visualize all the measurements, I compiled the values into a bar graph in Figure 5 below:

                                <p class="figure-label"><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Measured EMF values</p>

                                <p>The measurements reveal some interesting findings. 
                                The Bluetooth earbud showed the highest electric field strength at 104 V/m, which is concerning considering its close contact with the head during use. 
                                Kitchen appliances like the fridge, electric kettle, and microwave also ranked high, with values of 82 V/m, 49 V/m, and 42 V/m, respectively. 
                                Because these devices are such kitchen staples, it is easy to brush past the EMF fields they may generate. 
                                In terms of magnetic flux density, the electric toothbrush took the lead with a strength of 19.59 uT, raising concerns about its proximity to a vital organ—the brain. 
                                Similarly, the kitchen appliances previously mentioned also exhibited elevated magnetic flux density values.

                                <p>From a general standpoint, the WHO establishes higher EMF radiation limits compared to those of the EMF reader. 
                                It also appears as if the EMF reader guidelines were more generalized. 
                                This disparity in limits suggests a notable divergence safety threshold. 
                                It seems as if the WHO adopts a broader and potentially more holistic approach, while the EMF reader adheres to a more specific and uniform set of standards. 
                                The graphs in Figures 6, 7, and 8 below compare the measured values from before against these two limits.

                                <p>I was surprised by the number of devices that surpassed their designated limits for both electric field and magnetic flux density. 
                                Specifically, 40% and 70% of the devices exceeded the E-field and B-field limits, respectively, according to the EMF reader guidelines. 
                                Additionally, 30% of the devices surpassed both E-field and B-field limits as per the WHO guidelines. 
                                Notably, the AC power WHO limit was never exceeded. 
                                On average, more devices surpassed the magnetic flux density limit than the electric field strength limit. 
                                It's crucial to acknowledge the relatively small sample size and the potential susceptibility of the measurement device to minor errors.
                                </p>
                                <p>In an attempt to find a third limit, I checked if the US government has any standards on EMF radiation. 
                                It turns out, there are no official federal limits set for EMF exposure. 
                                Notably, only six states have established limits explained in Figure 9 below, mostly applying specifically to power lines.
                                </p>

                                <p>Navigating the different EMF radiation limits is like trying to traverse through a maze, it is difficult to tell which directions are valid. 
                                Given the inconsistencies, it is hard to distinguish the line between safe and unsafe. 
                                I know I certainly did! Addressing these discrepancies and establishing evidence-based guidelines for EMF exposure is essential given how technology-centric we are as a society. 
                                I still find it surprising that, for such a developed country, the United States still has no federal standards for EMF radiation.

                                <h5>How do EMFs Influence the Human Body?</h5>
                                <p>Both electric and magnetic fields are capable of inducing voltages and currents in the human body. 
                                The human body relies on electric charges to function through biochemical reactions. 
                                For example, our brain activity, digestive behavior, and heartbeat are all electrically active. 
                                The strength of the induced current and voltage depends on the intensity of the EMF radiation exposure [1].
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>Now the question is, are they dangerous enough to create adverse effects on the body? 
                                Heating is the main biological effect of EMF fields. 
                                Yes, I said heating not cancer. 
                                To date, scientists and regulatory agencies agree that low-frequency EMFs pose little danger to overall human health. 
                                The human body is extremely sophisticated and has mechanisms within to adjust to the various influences of our environment. 
                                With that being said, it is admitted that more research is needed especially for long-term exposure. 
                                Stress on our biological system for a prolonged period may contribute to a health risk [1]. 
                                Just think about how close your phone is to your body at all points of the day!

                                <p>Similar to the variability in safety limitations, there exists a wide range of inconsistencies in research on the effects of EMF on the human body. 
                                Several of these claims about EMF radiation were analyzed in a systematic review. 
                                Many of them were found to have issues with the way experiments were conducted. 
                                It was concluded that for the experiments in question, there were likely no concerning physical effects on the body [17]. 
                                Publications that contradict these findings may get more attention due to the additional scare factor. 
                                This may be the same reason as to why the claim that vaccinations caused autism gained so much traction. 
                                Despite scientific evidence refuting this connection, misinformation fueled vaccine hesitancy and contributed to outbreaks of preventable diseases [18]. 
                                It is not confirmed that this is the same case for EMF radiation; however, it is important to keep in mind when reviewing a subject area susceptible to misinformation.
                                </p>

                                <p>In the same vein, it is also important to note that this is just one review and there are approximately 25,000 articles that have been published over the last 30 years on the topic of non-ionizing EMF radiation on the body [1]. 
                                This is why when reviewing content, it is crucial to cross-check with various sources and ensure that you are seeking information from credible publishers.
                                </p>

                                <p>You might be wondering why there have been so many published articles yet there is still a need for more research. 
                                This also ties in with the fact that current research does not necessarily mean a clear understanding surrounding EMF radiation. 
                                Here are some potential reasons I have considered as to why this may be the case:
                                </p>

                                <ol>
                                    <li>Studies on non-ionizing EMF radiation vary widely in terms of methodologies, exposure levels, and measurements. This is especially true for the duration and intensity of exposure [17].</li>
                                    <li>Biological systems are complex and the human body's response to EMFs is not fully understood [1].</li>
                                    <li>There may be a publication bias which may give an incomplete picture of research findings.</li>
                                    <li>Non-ionizing radiation comes from a vast variety of sources from a light bulb to wireless technology. Natural and artificial EMFs exist everywhere, and it is difficult to standardize them [4].</li>
                                </ol>

                                <h4>How Can I Reduce My Exposure?</h4>
                                <p>While there is still so much unknown regarding EMF radiation, it is still better to play it safe than sorry when talking about exposure. 
                                Here are some simple ways in which you can control your intake of EMF radiation:
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Move farther away from a device.</strong></li>
                                    <p>EMF radiation has an inverse square relationship with distance. Exposure rapidly decreases as distance from the source increases [19]. This applies to the phone in your pocket!</p>
                                    <li><strong>Disconnect devices more frequently.</strong></li>
                                    <p>EMF levels increase when a device is connected to Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Switch devices to airplane mode or disconnect to reduce exposure [20].</p>
                                    <li><strong>Unplug devices occassionally.</strong></li>
                                    <p>EMFs are created from moving charges which are present when your device is charging [20]. Try to unplug devices that are not regularly used such as a standing lamp or printer.</p>
                                    <li><strong>Create EMF-reduced zones.</strong></li>
                                    <p>The most effective way to block EMF radiation is by using a Faraday's cage. This is the same phenomenon that protects you against lightning strikes from within a metal car. Faraday's cages can be placed around EMF-emitting devices; however, they must be completely enclosed [21]. This can be inconvenient, especially if you are planning to use the device consistently. In that case, physical barriers such as a wall can also be effective [19].</p>
                                </ol>

                                <p>These are a few practical methods to reduce exposure, creating a balance between technological convenience and EMF vulnerability. 
                                Feel free to follow them at your discretion. 
                                Ultimately, we each have control over our exposure. 
                                Taking proactive steps toward minimizing overall exposure levels may prove worthwhile in the long run while it is still difficult to distinguish between fact and fallacy. 
                                I personally plan to take a more informed and cautious approach to technology usage going forward.

                                <p>Don't fall for marketing pit traps! Some corporations have capitalized on the fear surrounding EMF radiation. 
                                Here are some products that are ineffective and should be avoided:
                                </p>

                                There are a ton of other products only on Amazon, such as EMF neutralizer plugs, EMF shielding clothing, EMF blocking cases, and more that target this concern. 
                                So how do you discern whether a product is offering genuine protection or if it's just snake oil? 
                                It boils down to conducting thorough research, considering credible sources, and cross-validating information. 
                                Don't solely rely on promotional material! When I was browsing through these products on Amazon, a lot of them had a 4+ star rating even though I knew some of them were completely ineffective.

                                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                                <p>As a student in engineering, my daily life revolves around electronic devices. 
                                From the initial buzz of my morning alarm to the quiet hum of my electric kettle before bedtime, I've become increasingly aware of the invisible EMF waves that surround me. 
                                I took matters into my own hands by running an EMF presence assessment on my everyday devices. 
                                The measurements shed light on the surprisingly high electric and magnetic field strengths emitted by common devices. 
                                A Bluetooth earbud measuring at 104 V/m and an electric toothbrush at 19.59 uT, among others, raised eyebrows, prompting me to look closer at safety limits.
                                </p>
                                <p>Despite the measurements, navigating the confusion of EMF radiation limits proved challenging. 
                                Inconsistencies, from general limits set by international organizations to specific guidelines tailored to commercial EMF readers, had me questioning what to believe. 
                                The lack of a federal standard for EMF radiation in the United States adds another layer of complexity and emphasizes the need for clearer guidelines.
                                </p>
                                <p>While the concern over EMF radiation grows, the key lies in striking a balance between technological convenience and smart usage. 
                                As a student fully immersed in the digital era, I am reminded of the need for ongoing research, transparent guidelines, and consumer awareness. 
                                As we continue to explore the impact of EMFs on our health, I encourage you to take the initiative to stay informed about how EMF radiation may be impacting your quality of life. 
                                Thanks for reading!
